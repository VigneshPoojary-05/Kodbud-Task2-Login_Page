# üöÄ Responsive Login & Registration Form  

A fully responsive **Login & Registration Form** built as part of my **Kodbud Internship**.  
This project was created using **AI-assisted coding** (initial structure generated with an AI tool) and then **customized & optimized manually** to meet all requirements.  

---

## ‚ú® Overview  

This project focuses on creating a **modern, responsive, and functional authentication system** with proper **form validation, error handling, and smooth user experience**.  
It demonstrates how **AI tools can accelerate development**, while real coding skills are essential for refining, debugging, and enhancing the final product.
